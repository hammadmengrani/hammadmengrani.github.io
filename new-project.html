        <h3>official info on cats</h3>
        <p id="bio"><img id="beautiful-cat" src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/cat.png" width="400"> The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic
            cat or housecat to distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for 
            its companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years, 
            and are currently the most popular pet in the world. Owing to their close association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere 
            on Earth.</p>
            <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth
                    adapted to killing small prey. As nocturnal predators, cats use their acute hearing and ability to see in near darkness to 
                    locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans 
                    can perceive. This is because cats' usual prey (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so cats' hearing 
                    has evolved to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats rely more on smell than taste, and have a vastly better sense of smell
                    than humans.</p>
                    <p>Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use a variety of vocalizations, pheromones and types of body 
                            language for communication. These include meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting.</p>
                            <p>Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, 
                                    a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering and the abandonment of former
                                    household pets has resulted in problems caused by large numbers of feral cats worldwide, with a population of up to
                                    60 million of these animals in the United States alone</p>
